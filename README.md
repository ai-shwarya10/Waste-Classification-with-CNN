# Waste-Classification-with-CNN
Development of a Waste Segregation Model Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Global waste generation is a critical issue, with approximately 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste produced annually, projected to rise to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050. Currently, only about 33% of this waste is recycled, emphasizing the urgent need for effective waste segregation solutions to improve recycling rates and reduce environmental impact.

As global waste generation continues to rise, effective waste management has become a pressing challenge. Improper waste segregation at the source leads to increased landfill use, higher greenhouse gas emissions, and the loss of potentially recyclable materials. Traditional methods of waste sorting are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and prone to human error, resulting in significant amounts of recyclable materials being discarded as general waste.

To address this issue, we propose the development of an automated waste segregation model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This model aims to accurately classify and segregate waste materials into distinct categories—such as plastics, metals, paper, and organic waste—based on their visual characteristics. By leveraging the power of deep learning and image recognition, the model will enhance the efficiency and accuracy of waste sorting processes, ultimately contributing to improved recycling rates and reduced environmental impact.

The objectives of this project include:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a diverse dataset of waste images representing various categories and conditions, ensuring the model is trained on a comprehensive range of waste types.
2. Model Development: Design and implement a CNN architecture tailored for waste classification, optimizing for accuracy and speed in real-time applications.
3. Performance Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring it meets the necessary standards for practical deployment.
4. Integration and Deployment: Develop a user-friendly interface for the model, allowing for easy integration into existing waste management systems and facilitating real-time waste segregation in various settings, such as households, businesses, and public spaces.

By creating an effective waste segregation model using CNNs, we aim to promote sustainable waste management practices, reduce landfill dependency, and foster a circular economy through enhanced recycling efforts.
